# Visual-Recognition-System
Lab1 for CS 188 UCLA

I developed a Python program using OpenCV, Numpy, and Scikit-learn libraries to build a set of visual recognition systems that can identify scenes in different images
o	Uses SIFT, SURF, or ORB descriptors to capture local information in a training image and then K-means or hierarchical agglomerative clustering to build a Bag of Words represent vocabulary 
o	Uses K Nearest Neighbors or SVM Classifiers to identify the contents of an image
o homework1.py will use the functions defined in utils.py to perform all combinations of the tests and save outputs to files.
